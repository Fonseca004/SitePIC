In this third week, we were primarily focused on finishing the website and blog, ensuring that they are fully functional and ready for launch on March 4th. Although we had some visual issues, the website launch was assured and successful. At the moment, we have a simple version of our website, however, we plan to update and enhance it over the duration of this project, making it more dynamic, with more features and more visually appealing.

We delved deeper into our technological solution, considering what would be the best approach for the moving mechanism that we intend to implement in our project. This moving mechanism involves the top layer of our drying rack, that can possibly move in a horizontal axis, and in the side layers, that would adjust themselves, moving around their own axis, to protect the clothes from the rain according to the level of precipitation. Our main focus with this design is to ensure the dryness of the clothes and the simplicity of the design, notwithstanding the fact that there may be flaws when the idea is actually tested.
