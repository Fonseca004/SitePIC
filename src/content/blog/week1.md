We began by assessing the market to determine whether our product was truly needed or if we were attempting to solve a non-existent problem. After conducting a survey, we confirmed that the problem was worth addressing. Further research revealed that there were no competitors, highlighting the innovative potential of our project if successfully implemented.

We also divided the team based on areas of expertise. While everyone will be involved in all aspects of the project, certain members will focus more on specific areas.
