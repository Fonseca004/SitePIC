This week, we started some 3D modelling of pieces we would like to implement in the overall structure of our product, namely the casings that could connect the slats to the walls of the rack. Here we have to consider how we want these same slats to move.

Additionally, we started to review our material so far and assess our current status. This was especially important due to the fact that we were also preparing the mid term presentation that would soon come.
