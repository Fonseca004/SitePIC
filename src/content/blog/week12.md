This week, our main focus was preparing the presentation we delivered, aiming to clearly and effectively convey our ideas to professors and classmates. Throughout the process, we received valuable feedback â€” some suggestions had already been considered, such as the use of weather forecast APIs, while others, particularly regarding the mechanical component's structure, highlighted areas that require further exploration. 

In parallel, we began planning the content to be included in the WebApp, for which we drafted some initial sketches of possible layouts and functionalities. Next week, two team members will attend a workshop on WebApp development, which will help us solidify our understanding and move forward more confidently with its implementation.
