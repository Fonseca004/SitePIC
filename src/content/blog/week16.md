## Structure

This week, we developed the entire wooden support structure, which will serve as the main skeleton of the prototype.

We also printed the previously modelled 3D printed parts. However, during assembly, some technical challenges were identified:

- The holes intended for the blade shafts had the same thickness as the shafts themselves, which made fitting difficult. To solve this issue, it was necessary to lightly sand the parts to ensure a smoother fit without compromising their integrity.

- Transferring the holes from the acrylic support plates from one side of the drying rack to the other proved to be a complex task, requiring great precision to ensure proper alignment between all components.

- Defining the ideal distance between the gears was also challenging, as it was necessary to find a balance between minimizing slack and avoiding excessive pressure that could hinder smooth movement.

- Each adjustment attempt required repeating the entire assembly process, as even small deviations in the position of the acrylic plates resulted in overly tight fits or misalignments.

Despite these challenges, we ended the week with a functional prototype. The mechanism for the upper part of the drying rack still needs to be developed, along with designing an outer casing to make the final structure more aesthetically pleasing and refined.


### WebApp

During this phase of the project, several tests were conducted to evaluate the usability and intuitiveness of the application with users. Relevant feedback was collected from stakeholders, particularly the supervising professor, who suggested implementing a clear distinction between the automatic and manual modes. This feature will allow users to block the entire system if desired, increasing control and safety in the application's use.

In parallel, a new icon for the WebApp was designed, aiming to make the interface more visually appealing and aesthetically pleasing.


### Video and Poster

This week marked the beginning of the recording process for the project presentation video. The team is currently in the editing phase, with the goal of finalizing the content as quickly as possible in order to collect feedback before the final submission.

Regarding the poster presentation, several concepts were developed by different group members. Currently, a comparative analysis of the different graphic prototypes is underway, in order to select the one that best communicates, clearly and effectively, the purpose and functionalities of SmartRack.
