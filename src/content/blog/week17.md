### WebApp 

As mentioned in the previous week, a distinction was made between automatic and manual operation modes. When the automatic mode is selected, the SmartRack operates autonomously using sensors and programmed automation. In manual mode, the user selects the drying rack’s state (open or closed), however it remains in the selected state until a new action is taken by the user. 

### Video and Poster 

This week marked the beginning of the recording process for the project presentation video. The team is currently editing the footage with the goal of finalizing the content as quickly as possible, allowing time for feedback collection before the final submission. 

Regarding the presentation poster, several concepts have been developed by different team members. At this stage, a comparative analysis of the different graphic prototypes is being conducted, in order to select the one that best communicates, clearly and effectively, the purpose and functionalities of the SmartRack. 

### Pitch Deck 

We have finalized the Pitch Deck and have started preparing the presentation.
