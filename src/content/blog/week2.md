This week, we met with civil builder Martins Dias, who also accepted to be our mentor during the duration of this project and gave us some privileged insight on the market and the pros and cons of our project. He also helped us understand how we could make our product useful and more appealing to contractors – our new stakeholders. We’ve decided to change our perspective and, instead of trying to create a universal solution to our problem, we compromised ourselves to create our project for newly built houses.

We started by creating some new sketches and 3D animations to support our new concept and, even though we are not fully sure how the project will turn out, we have reached new heights in the conceptualization of our project.

At the same time, we started working on this website and blog and finalized the week by updating our pitch deck presentation, specifically our validation metrics, which must be met to ensure the project’s success.
