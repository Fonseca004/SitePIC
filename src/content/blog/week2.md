We met with Eng. Martins Dias who gave us some insight on the market and told us how we could make our product useful and appealing to contractors - our first customers.

This was the first week we actually started working on our product. After some sketches we began designing and animating our ideas in blender. At the same time we started working on the website and blog structure.

We finalized the selection of our validation metrics, which must be met to ensure the project's success.
