This week, we started by creating a simple 3D model for our project ensuring that we can easily visualize how to come upon our problem. After some failed attempts printing our product, we have achieved what have come to be our first prototype.

In this first prototype, the lateral rotational parts are immobile in an angle we considered favorable for the analysis of the project. The top layer of our prototype is an attachment so we can further analyse how to fully implement this solution.

We also talked to a professional UX designer that gave us feedback on how to improve and make our website and blog more appealing. This feedback was valuable and will be used in the next few weeks while we keep updating the website.

Furthermore, we also set plans to conduct interviews with some professionals in the field of civil engineering and control systems but, unfortunately, due to non-compatible schedules, these interviews were postponed and will happen in the near future.
