This week, our main focus was the development of our pitch deck presentation and defining the material list needed for our solution.

In meeting with our scientific advisor, we concluded that there were many changes to be made in order to improve our presentation. With that in mind, we were advised to:
- Improve our competitors and previous research, making comparisons between our work and theirs;
- Create a more intuitive and simple schedule;
- Show mathematical fundamentals for our validation metrics;
- Show more appealing images of our product;
- Re-evaluate the technical challenges faced by the team;

Relative to deciding which components to use, due to our lack of knowledge in the field, we resorted to professional assistance and asked Eng. Nuno Ferreira what components would fit better in our solution. He was kind enough to provide us with a detailed list with which components would better fit our product and also gave us assistance in better understanding the operation of our product.

Finally, we also scheduled a meeting with a professional mechanical engineer with the objective of helping us define how to move our product.
